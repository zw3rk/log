		<p>After
<a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk/building-ghc-the-package-database-50c37cf6ce33">getting
to know package databases</a> we are going to look into the set of tools
that are used when building the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.</p>
<h2 id="alex-and-happy">alex &amp; happy</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.haskell.org/alex/doc/html/index.html">alex</a> is a tool to
generate lexical analysers in Haskell, and as such can turn =.x= files
into =.hs= files.
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/happy/doc/html/index.html">happy</a> is a parser
generator, which can turn =.y= files into =.hs= files.</p>
<h2 id="ghc-pkg">ghc-pkg</h2>
<p>We saw during
<a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk/building-ghc-the-package-database-50c37cf6ce33">getting
to know package databases</a>. It is the command line interface to the
package databases.</p>
<h2 id="ghc-cabal">ghc-cabal</h2>
<p>While cabal comes with the <code>Cabal</code> library and the <code>cabal</code> command line
tool in the <code>cabal-install</code> package. The build system needs an easy way
to just extract values from =.cabal= files and add some customizations
to configuring, copying, and registering packages via cabal. This is
what <code>ghc-cabal</code> is for. It produces the <code>package-data.mk</code> file, which
is a Makefile that contains information from the =.cabal= file, such as
it&rsquo;s Haskell Sources, C Sources, &hellip; and as such provides the Make based
build system with sufficient information to build all the libraries.
<em>Yes, we do</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>use</em> <code>cabal</code> <em>to build GHC.</em></p>
<h2 id="deriveconstants">deriveConstants</h2>
<p>This utility is used during the build process to generate header files
containing constant values (word sizes, &hellip;) of the target platform and
when the compiler is built those are included to provide those target
specific information.</p>
<h2 id="hsc2hs">hsc2hs</h2>
<p>When binding to C libraries, the process can be quite tedious and
<code>hsc2hs</code> tries to make this a bit easier. It is also used quite a lot
outside of GHC itself. It even has its own
<a href="http://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/utils.html#writing-haskell-interfaces-to-c-code-hsc2hs">GHC
User&rsquo;s Guide entry</a>.</p>
<h2 id="genapply-and-genprimopcode">genapply &amp; genprimopcode</h2>
<p>GHCs runtime system needs to apply functions of various arities when
evaluating a program. <code>genapply</code> produces the <code>AutoApply.cmm</code> file which
is part of the <code>rts</code> package. The <code>AutoApply.cmm</code> file defines the
standard closures used to represent application of functions of various
artities.</p>
<p>Functions that can not be implement in Haskell directly are called
Primitive Operations (PrimOps) while these functions are provided
natively by GHC, the <code>genprimopcode</code> utility uses a highlevel
description of the PrimOps in the <code>compiler/prelude/primops.txt.pp</code> and
produces the necessary plumbing around them: header files, curried
wrappers, haddock information.</p>
<h2 id="touchy">touchy</h2>
<p>While unix systems have the <code>touch</code> command. Windows does not. As GHC
uses <code>touch</code> during building and compilation of Haskell files, <code>touchy</code>
is required on Windows as a substitute.</p>
<h2 id="unlit">unlit</h2>
<p>As GHC has support for Literate Haskell, it needs to be able to extract
the Haskell source from a =.lhs= source file. <code>unlit</code> is the filter that
can stirp the literate part out of a =.lhs= file and just leave
the =.hs= part.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="comparesizes">compareSizes</h2>
<p>When comparing two ghc builds, it can be of interest to see whether or
not the file size of haskell interface files (<code>.hi</code>) or objects (<code>.o</code>)
has increased or decreased. As such the compareSizes utility is not
essential to build GHC, but useful when trying to gauge what effect a
change has on interface and object file sizes.</p>
<h2 id="hp2ps">hp2ps</h2>
<p>The <code>hp2ps</code> tool is also widely used. It turns a heap profile generated
by GHC into a (hopefully) easier to undertand graphical representation.</p>
<h2 id="ghctags">ghctags</h2>
<p><code>vim</code> and <code>emacs</code> can read so called <code>TAGS</code> files, which provide an
index to source-code definitions of function, variables, and other
points of interest.</p>
<p><code>ghctags</code> is capable of generating such a file for Haskell sources. As
such it is also a not an essential utility to <em>build</em> GHC.</p>
<h2 id="hpc">hpc</h2>
<p>The <code>hpc</code> tool can be used to generate code coverage reports for Haskell
code. It even has it&rsquo;s own
<a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell%5Fprogram%5Fcoverage">page on the haskell
wiki</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>In conclusion I hope this was somewhat informative. And while not all
tools are strictly used to <em>build</em> GHC. I believe this covers all the
utilities that are part of the GHC source tree.</p>
