<div class="post-line"></div>

		

		<p>In
<a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk/building-ghc-the-package-database-50c37cf6ce33">part
one</a> we learned about the package database.
<a href="https://medium.com/@zw3rk/building-ghc-the-tools-3d170a4db06c">Part
two</a> then introduced the tools and programs built when building GHC. In
this part we will look at how the actual stages are built. I will not go
into the detail of the make based build system, but try to give an
overall understanding what is happening conceptually.</p>
<p>To build GHC usually involves running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./boot                                   (1)
./configure --prefix=/usr/opt            (2)
make -j                                  (3)
make install                             (4)
</code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break down what is happening here: running =./boot= generates
<code>ghc.mk</code> make files throughout the source tree unless the folder already
contains one. It also runs <code>autoreconf</code> where necessary (e.g. if there
exists a <code>configure.ac</code> file, <code>autoreconf</code> is run to turn those into
<code>configure</code> scripts for the respective libraries).</p>
<p>The next step, running =./configure= (which can be take a few
parameters, see =./configure &ndash;help=) runs a battery of detection
functions to collect information about the machine GHC is built on. This
includes but is not limited to paths to tools, the architecture,
operating system, if the system builds Position Independent Executables
by default, and more. The collected results will then be substituted
in =.in= files in the build system producing files without the =.in=
extension where those values are embedded (e.g. turns <code>settings.in</code> into
<code>settings</code>).</p>
<p>At this point we now have primed the source tree to contain the
necessary build (and possibly target specific) information to be used
throughout building GHC.</p>
<p><code>make</code> will then run the make build system to produce <code>ghc</code>, the package
database to be shipped with <code>ghc</code> and other utilities (e.g. <code>ghc-pkg</code>).</p>
<p>Finally <code>make install</code> will move those into place, which would be
<code>/usr/opt</code> in the example above. At this point the GHC build system is
done.</p>
<hr>
<p>With that out the door, let&rsquo;s take a closer look what <code>make</code> actually
does. GHC is built in <strong>stages</strong>. And there are usually three stages
involved. We build the <em>stage 1 compiler</em> with the <em>stage 0 compiler</em>,
and the <em>stage 2 compiler</em> with the <em>stage 1 compiler</em>.</p>
<p>Stage 0 is the <em>bootstrap stage</em>. The bootstrap stage is built by the
<em>bootstrap ghc</em> this is the GHC that is already present on the system.
The bootstrap ghc comes with it&rsquo;s package database that was installed
when the bootstrap compiler was installed.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-stage-1-compiler">Building the stage 1 compiler</h2>
<p>As the compiler quite often depends on features of libraries it depends
on that are not guaranteed to be new enough in the bootstrap compilers
package database, the first step is to augment the bootstrap compilers
package database with those required packages to build the Stage 1
compiler. To do this, we compile this set of <em>bootstrap packages</em> with
the bootstrap compiler.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Yy35bpqSR%5FejoxMut0J6yA.png"
         alt="Figure 1: My stage0 package database."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 1: My stage0 package database.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><em>Note: my stage 0 package database contains the</em> <code>data-bitcode-*</code>
<em>packages which make up my</em> <code>llvm-ng</code> <em>backend.</em></p>
<p>From the <code>base</code> version <code>4.10.0.0</code> we can infer that this is likely the
package database that was shipped with ghc <code>8.2.1</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>ghc-8.3</code> package will not be in the package database initially,
however we can see that all it&rsquo;s dependencies are part of the package
database. As such building the actual <code>ghc</code> executable with the
<em>bootstrap compiler</em> is now possible. So we move on to build <code>ghc</code>,
<code>ghc-pkg</code>, <code>hsc2hs</code> and other tools with the <em>bootstrap compiler</em>. These
together with the the augmented bootstrap package database constitute
the <em>stage 1</em> now.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-stage-2-compiler">Building the stage 2 compiler</h2>
<p>With the <em>stage 1</em> compiler, and the augmented bootstrap package
database, we proceed by compiling all libraries that ship with GHC and
register them in the <em>stage 1 package database</em> (these are packages
built <em>with</em> the <em>stage 1 compiler</em>). And we finally build the <code>ghc</code>
with the <em>stage 1 compiler</em> as well as other utilities we want to ship
with the <em>stage 2 compiler</em>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2UOLozz3AUW60NBmzR2-4g.png"
         alt="Figure 2: My stage1 package database."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Figure 2: My stage1 package database.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We could now iterate this process again and obtain a <em>stage 3 compiler</em>
built with the <em>stage 2 compiler</em>, or go on and build and register
additional packages into the <em>stage 1 package database</em> with the <em>stage
2 compiler.</em> I hope the idea and approach should be sufficiently
illustrated at this point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So why did we need to build the compiler <em>twice</em>, wouldn&rsquo;t the <em>stage
1 compiler</em> and the <em>stage 1 package database</em> have been enough?
That&rsquo;s a good question! We need to build the <em>stage 2 compiler</em> with
the <em>stage 1 compiler</em> using the <em>stage 1 package database</em> (the one
we will ship with the <em>stage 2 compiler</em>). As such, the compiler is
built with the identical libraries that it ships with. When running /
interpreting byte code, we need to dynamically link packages and this
way we can guarantee that the packages we link are identical to the
ones the compiler was built with. This it is also the reason why we
don&rsquo;t have GHCi or Template Haskell support in the <em>stage 1 compiler</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-binary-distribution">A binary distribution</h2>
<p>To build a binary distribution from our final <em>stage 2 compiler</em> we only
need the <code>ghc</code> (built with the <em>stage 1 compiler</em> which was built with
the <em>bootstrap compiler</em>) together with the <em>stage 1 package database</em>
(built with the <em>stage 1 compiler</em>). There is some additional packaging
logic, which I will not go into, but only mention: we package an
additional <code>configure</code> script to adapt the system on which GHC will
ultimately be installed, and make sure the wrapper scripts around GHC
all contain the correct absolute paths, and additional files (e.g.
<code>settings</code>) are included in the binary distribution as well.</p>

questions, please ask!</p>
