		<h2 id="march-and-april-edition">March &amp; AprilÂ Edition</h2>
<p>Due to some travel in April, I wasn&rsquo;t able to write up an update for
what happened in March. So today we&rsquo;ll have a combined update for
March and April.</p>
<p>Alp Mestanogullari has finished <a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/pull/531">hadrian#531</a>, which was a clean up of
my earlier <a href="https://github.com/snowleopard/hadrian/pull/445">hadrian#445</a>. As such we now build relocatable GHCs with
hadrian by default! ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>I have been making progress on the Windows front to the point where we
don&rsquo;t even need a windows installation anymore, and run the iserv
slave via WINE. More on that soon!</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve had to work a lot more with nix recently, I&rsquo;ve come to hit the
limitations of the current Haskell infrastructure in nix with respect
to cross compilation. Specifically the flattening of conditionals
(os/arch/flags) that <code>cabal2nix</code> does. This resulted in <a href="https://github.com/angerman/Cabal2Nix">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/angerman/haskell.nix">new</a> <a href="https://github.com/angerman/hackage.nix">tooling</a>
and a bit <a href="https://github.com/angerman/stackage.nix">more</a>. This is in its early stages, and I will expand on this
properly once it has matured a little.</p>
<p>Finally I started looking into adding <code>-target</code> to GHC. This will
certainly be a very long road, but I think we do have most of the
necessary bits in place to make GHC multi-target. It will however
require not only changes to GHC, but also to the build system, to
build the relevant libraries in the right places, as well as to the
tooling around.</p>
