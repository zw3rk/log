## June Edition {#june-edition}

This post will be quite brief. I wasn't able to carve out much time in
June as my wife an I have just welcomed a new human being.

As the
[8.6.1
alpha was just announced](https://mail.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2018-June/129361.html), I'm trying to finish adapting the `llvm-ng`
backend as quickly as I can and build a fresh set of pre-built ghc 8.6.1
cross compilers.
