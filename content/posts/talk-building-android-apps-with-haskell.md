## haskell.sg Meetup --- January 2018 {#haskell-dot-sg-meetup-january-2018}

At the [haskell.sg
January Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/HASKELL-SG/events/246341959/) I presented building Android apps with Haskell
yesterday. As we have recordings set up for a while now, you can follow
it below. The talk is rather short and will only outline how to install
the cross compilers, setup an Android app and call Haskell from Kotlin
to display “Hello from Haskell”. It should hopefully provide a good
starting point to start playing with the cross compilers.

The source code for the sample application can be found on
[github](https://github.com/angerman/2018-01-MeetupDemo).
