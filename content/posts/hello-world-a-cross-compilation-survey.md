we are **zw3rk**, the haskell focused team at
[lichtzwerge.com](https://lichtzwerge.com). Our mission is to make
haskell a viable platform for mobile development.

What does **zw3rk** stand for you might ask? It's a simple play on words,
combining the German word Zwerg (engl. dwarf/gnome) and Werk (engl.
factory) with the almighty three!

The current state of ghc for _mobile development_ (Android and iOS) via
cross compilation is not as smooth as we'd like. Together with
[obsidian.systems](https://obsidian.systems) we intend to _improve the
status quo considerably_!

To kick this off, we have prepared a
[survey regarding cross
compilation](https://goo.gl/forms/VBUF0dQDgVm7hjrv2) with ghc (not just for mobile development) and would like
to invite you to help us understand the needs of the community better.
Please follow [this link](https://goo.gl/forms/VBUF0dQDgVm7hjrv2) to
participate! **Please note: the survey has ended on May 4th.**

To keep up to date with the development, you can follow us here on
medium, on [github](https://github.com/zw3rk), or on
